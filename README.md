# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX
This capstone is mainly to present a story that explores the success landing rate of falcon 9 as a data scientist
SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010.
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars wheras other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch.
